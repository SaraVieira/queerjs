  <h2>COVID Safety</h2>
This event will be 2G, which means that to enter the venue you'll be asked to show a digital proof of either full vaccination or recovery from COVID. If you cannot be vaccinated due to health reasons, please contact us at hey@queerjs.com
<br/><br/>
For COVID safety, the event is capped at 50 people. The venue can support up to 80 people, but we are leaving space for distancing.
<br/><br/>
Out of consideration to the safety of attendees, we will only be admitting people who have registered.
<br/><br/>
  <h2>What?</h2>
This is a meetup where anyone is welcome to attend and support the speakers and the idea but all the speakers will be Queer.
<br/><br/>
This meetup exists to give a voice to everyone, to make a safe space where everyone is welcome.
<br/><br/>
<h2>About the Venue</h2>
c-base is located in Mitte, and is wheelchair accessible.
<br/><br/>
There is a gender neutral washroom that is the wheelchair accessible toilet.
<br/><br/>
If you have any questions or concerns about accessibility or need additional information to decide whether it is safe for you to attend, please reach out at <a href='mailto:hey@queerjs.com'>hey@queerjs.com</a>
