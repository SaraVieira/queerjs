        <Panel heading="How can I get involved?">
          There are a lot of ways you could get involved with QueerJS! We're always looking for new locations to
          host meetups, as well as folks on the ground to act as local organizers and MCs.
          <br/><br/>
          Involvement might mean working with your employers to provide a space, organizing catering for meetup
          attendees, ensuring that there is a livestream or opportunity to record the speakers, and generally working
          to ensure that the meetup runs smoothly.
          <br/><br/>
          If you think you'd like to do this, we'd love to work with you to make
          it happen - please contact us via {' '}
